Today, I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its tree. It <verb> through the large tunnel that led to its <adjective> <place>. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic <adjective> <animal>. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a <food> and ate it at the <place> stand. When I got home, I couldn't stop thinking about the <adjective> animals and how much fun I had at the zoo.
